"Ray Tracing from the Ground Up". Any similarities in the code

This is a visual studio application, the simplest way to run it is
to open it in said application.

I'm using nupengl.core.0.1.0.1 packages to run glut and OpenGL
commands to render the image. These packages should be included.
Visual studio's NuGet package manager was used to simplify the
installation of the above package, and it's probably the easiest
way to install them if another method doesn't work.
